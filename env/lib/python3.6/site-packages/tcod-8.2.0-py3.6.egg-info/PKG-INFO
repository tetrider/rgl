        =======
         About
        =======
        This is a Python cffi_ port of libtcod_.
        
        This library is `hosted on GitHub <https://github.com/libtcod/python-tcod>`_.
        
        Any issues you have with this module can be reported at the
        `GitHub issue tracker <https://github.com/libtcod/python-tcod/issues>`_.
        
        =======
         Usage
        =======
        This module was designed to be backward compatible with the original libtcodpy
        module distributed with libtcod.
        If you had code that runs on libtcodpy then you can use this library as a
        drop-in replacement.  This installs a libtcodpy module so you'll only need to
        delete the libtcodpy/ folder that's usually bundled in an older libtcodpy
        project.
        
        Guides and Tutorials for libtcodpy should work with the tcod module.
        
        The latest documentation can be found
        `here <https://python-tcod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
        
        ==============
         Installation
        ==============
        The recommended way to install is by using pip.  Older versions of pip will
        have issues installing tcod, so make sure it's up-to-date.
        
        Windows / MacOS
        ---------------
        To install using pip, use the following command::
        
            > python -m pip install tcod
        
        If you get the error "ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could
        not be found." when trying to import tcod/tdl then you may need the latest
        `Microsoft Visual C runtime
        <https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads>`_.
        
        Linux
        -----
        On Linux python-tcod will need to be built from source.
        Assuming you have Python, pip, and apt-get, then you'll run these commands to
        install python-tcod and its dependencies to your user environment::
        
            $ sudo apt-get install gcc python-dev python3-dev libsdl2-dev libffi-dev libomp5
            $ pip2 install tcod
            $ pip3 install tcod
        
        ==============
         Requirements
        ==============
        * Python 3.5+
        * Windows, Linux, or MacOS X 10.9+.
        * On Linux, requires libsdl2 (2.0.5+) and libomp5 to run.

        Deprecated
         - Deprecated all libtcodpy map functions.
        Fixed
         - `tcod.map_copy` could break the `tcod.map.Map` class.
         - `tcod.map_clear` `transparent` and `walkable` parameters were reversed.
         - When multiple SDL2 headers were installed, the wrong ones would be used when
           the library is built.
         - Fails to build via pip unless Numpy is installed first.
        
        4.5.0 - 2018-06-12

        Removed
         - No more debug output when loading fonts.
        
        4.4.0 - 2018-05-02
        ------------------
        Added
         - Added the libtcodpy module as an alias for tcod.  Actual use of it is
           deprecated, it exists primarily for backward compatibility.
         - Adding missing libtcodpy functions `console_has_mouse_focus` and
           `console_is_active`.
        Changed
         - Updated libtcod to v1.6.6
        
        4.3.2 - 2018-03-18
        ------------------
        Deprecated

           constant" error when building on platforms with an older cffi module and
           newer SDL headers.
         - tcod/tdl Map and Console objects were not saving stride data when pickled.
        
        4.3.0 - 2018-02-01
        ------------------
        Added
         - You can now set the numpy memory order on tcod.console.Console,
           tcod.map.Map, and tdl.map.Map objects well as from the
           tcod.console_init_root function.
        Changed
         - The `console_init_root` `title` parameter is now optional.
        Fixed
         - OpenGL renderer alpha blending is now consistent with all other render
           modes.

        ------------------
        Fixed
         - The Windows dynamic linker will now prefer the bundled version of SDL.
           This fixes:
           "ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified procedure could not be found."
         - `key.c` is no longer set when `key.vk == KEY_TEXT`, this fixes a regression
           which was causing events to be heard twice in the libtcod/Python tutorial.

        1.4.0 - 2015-06-22
        ------------------
        - The DLL's have been moved into another library which you can find at
          https://github.com/HexDecimal/libtcod-cffi
          You can use this library to have some raw access to libtcod if you want.
          Plus it can be used alongside TDL.
        - The libtocd console objects in Console instances have been made public.
        - Added tdl.event.wait function.  This function can called with a timeout and

        ------------------
        - Fixed pathfinding regressions.
        
        1.3.0 - 2015-06-19
        ------------------

        ------------------
        - The set_colors method now changes the default colors used by the draw_*
          methods.  You can use Python's Ellipsis to explicitly select default colors
          this way.
        - Functions and Methods renamed to match Python's style-guide PEP 8, the old
          function names still exist and are depreciated.
        - The fgcolor and bgcolor parameters have been shortened to fg and bg.
        
        1.1.7 - 2015-03-19
        ------------------
        - Noise generator now seeds properly.
        - The OS event queue will now be handled during a call to tdl.flush. This
          prevents a common newbie programmer hang where events are handled
          infrequently during long animations, simulations, or early development.
        - Fixed a major bug that would cause a crash in later versions of Python 3
        
        1.1.6 - 2014-06-27

        1.1.4 - 2013-03-06
        ------------------

        1.1.3 - 2012-12-17
        ------------------
        - Some of the setFont parameters were incorrectly labeled and documented.
        - setFont can auto-detect tilesets if the font sizes are in the filenames.
        - Added some X11 unicode tilesets, including unifont.

        ------------------
        - Window title now defaults to the running scripts filename.
        - Fixed incorrect deltaTime for App.update
        - App will no longer call tdl.flush on its own, you'll need to call this
          yourself.
        - tdl.noise module added.
        - clear method now defaults to black on black.
        
        1.1.1 - 2012-12-05
